# GPS-Tracker
This is a PoC project of GPS Tracker based on STM32L496ZG.

I've used the following components to make this project:

1. Nucleo-L496ZG evaluation board,
2. NEO-6M GPS module,
3. LIS2DW12 accelerometer,
4. SIM800L V2 GSM module,
5. digital buzzer.

Whole application uses either a demo code from the manufacturers of specific modules or other users who can be found on the GitHub - one of which is @nimaltd.
